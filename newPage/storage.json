At the time of writing I am 19 and I have been self-learning programming for ~6 years. I mostly enjoy programming in languages like C#, C, C++... One of my most useless skills is that I can do something in the J programming language. I enjoy functional programming (and Haskell) but I use it only when it makes sense."
