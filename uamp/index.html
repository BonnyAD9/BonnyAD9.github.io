        <h1>Uamp</h1>
        <h2>Universal Advanced Music Player</h2>
        <p>
            Uamp is minimal music player that doesn't get in your way. It is
            fast, reliable and powerful.
        </p>
        <h3>Why does Uamp exist?</h3>
        I was used to using winamp on windows. When I transitioned to Linux, I
        couldn't find any music player that would satisfy my needs:

        <ul>
            <li>
                Speed. I need fast music player capable of managing large
                amounts of local songs (my library has over 3000 songs). Many
                existing music players weren't able to handle this large amount
                of songs. Uamp has no problem with this number of songs, and is
                made to delegate expensive operations to other threads so that
                it never becomes unresponsive.
            </li>
            <li>
                Global keyboard shortcuts. I'm used to using global keyboard
                shortcuts to control my music player. Many music players don't
                have global keyboard shortcuts or any alternative or the
                shortcuts don't work well. Uamp also doesn't have any global
                keyboard shortcuts, but it can be controled with CLI. This
                makes it very simple to create keyboard shortcuts for the
                required actions in your window manager (e.g. Kwin).
            </li>
            <li>
                Fade play/pause. Since I discovered this feature in winamp, I
                can't use play/puase without it. It is very unpleasant when you
                pause/play your playback and it just transitions with silence
                immidietely. This feature adds few milliseconds where the
                volume changes from the current to 0 in case of pause and from
                0 to the current volume ensuring smooth transition between
                playback and silence. Uamp allows you to specify this fade
                duration and if you don't like it, you can just disable this
                feature.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fine control over low volumes. It is very annoying if the
                volume controls are liner. I remember using music player where
                the volume I wanted was between 0 and 5 % but the controls
                jumped in change of 5 % making huge changes to ghe volume. And
                on the other end of the scale, difference between 80 % and 100
                % was minimal. Ideal volume slider would be logarighmic, but
                this slider doesn't have good definition on finite range and so
                it would be very unintuitive to use. This is why I chose
                quadratic slider. This is simple yet good approximation of the
                logarithimc slider on finite volume range. This is why changes
                to low and high volumes in uamp feels to have much more
                consistant impact. Uamp also allows you to configure the volume
                jump, so you can set it to your liking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Endless playback. When I play music on background I usually
                play random mix of all of my songs. Many players make this
                operation quite hard or it is not implemented very well (it
                chooses random songs instead of using randomly mixed queue).
                In the end, every player has some way of achieving this. Uamp
                makes this very simple and goes further by automating the
                process of reshuffling the playlist when it finishes. Uamp has
                by default defined alias that will do exactly that: <i>randomly
                shuffle all songs. If playlist ends, reshuffle the playlist and
                continue from start. If new songs are added to the library,
                shuffle them into the current playlist after the current song
                position.</i> This is all done trough patemeters on playlist
                that allow define what will happen when the playlist ends and
                if and how new songs should be also added to the playlist.
            </li>
            <li>
                Returning to previous queue. Sometimes I want to listen to
                specific album. If I play this album, the current queue will be
                discarted. Uamp has stack of queues. You can play the specific
                album and have uamp continue with playing of the previous queue
                without modyfing the previous queue.
            </li>
            <li>
                Playing audio file that is not in library. Sometimes I just
                want to play audio file that is not in my song library and I
                don't want to add it to the song library. I just want to play
                it now once. Uamp allows you to do that. If you play any audio
                file that is not in your library, uamp will pause the current
                playback, push the audio file as new queue and when it finishes
                playing, uamp will continue with playback of the previous
                queue. The previous queue will stay unmodified and the audio
                file will not be added to the library.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Stability, reliability. If there is any bug in uamp I can
                    just fix it. I use uamp daily and if I encounter any issue,
                    I just fix it. If the issue in any way prevents me from
                    using uamp the way I want to, I just push new version of
                    uamp with the fix right away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some players stop the playback if there is any issue with
                    playing specific song. Uamp will just log that there was
                    issue, and silently continue to the next song.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some players dont't save their state when you forget to
                    properly close them. If you just turn you PC off, they will
                    forget all changes since they were open. If they for some
                    reason crash, the state will be also reset. Uamp properly
                    handles all exit signals and saves its state before
                    exiting. Uamp also periodically saves any changes to its
                    state so that if it would crash, the saved state is still
                    quite recent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some players for some reason have issues playing when other
                    demanding task is running on the PC. One I was using was
                    stuttering the audio when I was playing games. Since the
                    begining of uamp, I never encountered any issue of that
                    kind with uamp. Even if the CPU is running at 100 %, uamp
                    still plays.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Music player is also my dream project. Uamp is the realization of
            that dream project. When I was using winamp, I had no reason to
            create fully functional music player but after I started using
            Linux, I had to make myself usable music player.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to create uamp I had to make several rust libraries
            (crates) because the existing ones weren't good enough. This
            includes <a href="https://github.com/BonnyAD9/raplay">raplay</a>
            for playing audio, <a href="https://github.com/BonnyAD9/termal">
            termal</a> for colored printing to terminal (and other terminal
            manipulation) and <a href="https://github.com/BonnyAD9/pareg">
            pareg</a> as flexible command line argument parser (and parser in
            general).
        </p>
        <h3>Why should you use Uamp?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Speed and efficiency. Uamp uses minimal system resources while
                having no problem managing huge amounts of songs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Simplicity. This is not simplicity of use (although the CLI is
                friendly and well documented). Uamp is simple in principle.
                Music player should play music. That is what uamp does and does
                that very well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Advanced features. Uamp has many advanced features that will
                allow you to enjoy listening to your music. These features
                include gapless playback, fade play/pause, advanced queue
                (playlist) management (queue stack) and much more.
            </li>
            <li>
                No bloat. Uamp is single binary that is about 18 MiB. Once
                compiled, it doesn't depend on any other files except common
                system libraries.
            </li>
            <li>
                Documentation. Everything about uamp is well documented at
                multiple places. The complete basic CLI documentation is the
                help command. There are also two manual pages: 1 for the cli
                and general description and 5 for describing the documentation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>NO UI?</h3>
        <p>
            Lets address the elephant in the room. Uamp has no user interface.
            It is fully controled with commands from terminal. This was ment to
            be only temporary change, but in the process I realized that I
            didn't miss the UI. Uamp is ready to play when my PC starts without
            me even knowing it. I have assigned global shortcuts to the
            important actions such as Play/Pause, Next, Previous, Volume Up and
            Down, ... and now I interact with the terminal interface only when
            I need to do some specific actions. Uamp runs fully in the
            background and consumes minimal resources (almost no CPU usage,
            no GPU usage, 10 - 15 MiB of RAM).
        </p>
        <p>
            In future I may add TUI or GUI, but this will never become
            necesity. Uamp will stay fully usable without UI, and the potential
            future UI will be always optional (at compile time and of course at
            runtime).
        </p>
        <h3>Uamp is for you if:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You aren't afraid of terminal. (you will need to use it at
                least once)
            </li>
            <li>
                You don't like bloat. (uamp is small and uses minimal
                resources)
            </li>
            <li>
                You don't want your music player to get in your way. (if uamp
                doesn't play, you don't know its there)
            </li>
            <li>You use Linux. (I don't know of better player for Linux)</li>
            <li>You have local library of songs. (uamp plays local music)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Uamp is NOT for you if:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You have fear of terminal that you are unwilling to overcome.
                (you will need to use terminal at least once)
            </li>
            <li>
                You are not using Linux and uamp is not working properly.
                Support for other OSs is theoretical. I currently don't have
                any way to test anything on any other operating system.
            </li>
            <li>
                You found a better music player for linux. Please let me know
                :)
            </li>
            <li>
                You don't have local song library. You stream your songs from
                some streaming service. (uamp plays local music)
            </li>
        </ul>

        Of course these comparisions are very opinionated but there aren't any
        better comparisions with uamp, because noone knows about it. If you
        like uamp, consider giving it star on
        <a href="https://github.com/BonnyAD9/uamp">github</a> :).
