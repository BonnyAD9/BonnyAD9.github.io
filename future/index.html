            <div>
                I study at the University of Technology in Brno,
                specifically at the Faculty of Information Technology.
                At the time of writing I am 19 and I have been
                self-learning programming for ~6 years. I mostly enjoy
                programming in languages like rust, C, C++... One of my most
                useless skills is that I can do something in the J
                programming language. I enjoy functional programming (and
                Haskell) but I use it only when it makes sense.

                        Makemake is a powerful command-line interface (CLI)
                        program built with Rust, designed to simplify the
                        process of creating and managing project templates.
                        Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting
                        out, makemake is your go-to tool for boosting
                        productivity and maintaining consistency across your
                        projects.

                        With makemake, you can effortlessly generate customized
                        project templates that suit your specific needs. Say
                        goodbye to repetitive setup tasks and hello to
                        streamlined workflows. Simply define your desired
                        project structure, including files, directories, and
                        any other necessary assets, and let makemake do the
                        heavy lifting for you.

                        in any other music player app.

                        Currently the player is very far from complete. All you
                        can do is list music and play one song at a time.
